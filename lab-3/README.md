# To install node dependencies:

Navigate to the client or server folder and run:  

```bash
npm install
```

*Example C:/Workspace/dt/lab-3/client npm install*

__live-server__ library serves and automatically reloads the frontend and provides an application scope in which the events are triggered only whithin the tab where the client is opened.

__nodemon__ library is used to run and automatically reload the server if we change any source files.

These dependencies are tools that help us to run the client/server JS applications.

# Run command

Navigate to the client or server folder and run:  

```bash
npm run start
```

*Example C:/Workspace/dt/lab-3/client npm run start*

You can find the __start__ command defined in *package.json*.

# Important

Always start the server first and the client afterwards.
